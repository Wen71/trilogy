# Introduction

MNSU is partnered with a global consortium of astrophysicists to complete the largest ultraviolet survey ever made with the Hubble Space Telescope. This program, UVCANDELS, was completed in 2020 and data are now being processed. We would like to provide the public a sampling of the diversity and beauty of these galaxies by posting their images on the popular photo app Instagram. We developed a first-of-its-kind public outreach program in extragalactic astrophysics, writing an Instagram “bot” to post randomly-selected galaxies from the survey daily, with basic identifying information, and periodically provide commentary and explanator information on these data.

# Extragalactic Instagram Imaging

We provided a screenshot of the @UVC_BOT Instagram feed, which will be offically launched in Winder 2022.
